# sudoku-fp

A simple Sudoku solver to play with functional programming.

This currently uses the regex solver from
https://github.com/agriffis/sudoku-pcre but the supporting code is composable
functions, especially using [Ramda](http://ramdajs.com/).
Hoping to write an algorithmic functional solver next to replace the regex.
